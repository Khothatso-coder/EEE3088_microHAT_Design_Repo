# Motor driver with position feedback HAT
This Raspberry Pi add-on is perfect for any motion project as it can track positioning of Stepper motors and drive them with full PWM speed control.
Three modules of DC motor HAT for  Raspberry Pi board with an on-board motor controller, that keeps track of the position, speed and direction of the motor.
The HAT consists of power supply unit, motor driver IC, motor position feedback sensor providing an input signal within 0-3.3V
and LEDs status circuitry to monitor conditions of the motor.

We could use a fully-dedicated PWM driver chip onboard to both control motor direction and speed. This chip handles all the motor and speed controls over I2C.
Motors are controlled by MOSFET drivers with 1.5A per channel current capability.
