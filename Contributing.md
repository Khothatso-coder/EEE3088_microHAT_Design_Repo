# Contributing to this repository
We would appreciate your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Uploading submodules simulations files.
- Reporting any issues
- Discussing the current state of the microHAT
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host microHAT subsystems LTSpice files, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added simulated circuit that should be tested, add nodes to be tested.
3. Make your simulations produces output voltage that suits the microHAT GPIO pin voltage.
6. Issue that pull request

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit simulation changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues]
We use GitHub issues to track public errors/bugs. Report an issue by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy


## Use a Consistent LTSpice file naming style
* Filename must correspond to the name of the circuitry simulated
* All 3 files must be end with suffix: .asc, .plt and .log 

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT License.
